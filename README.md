# flask-guide

Step-by-step tutorial for building a simple Flask application using Python; optimized for use in a CS class.

## What We'll Do

By following along with this project and our lesson(s), you'll walk away with a skeleton for a fully functional Flask web-app. You'll have several roles for users, a db with several tables, and basic authentication. This is meant to serve as a template; however, the basic framework will allow you to create apps of any kind/focus.

## Instructions

Follow the instructions below to set up your development environment for completing this project.

### Before we meet

1. Clone this repo:

   ```Shell
   git clone https://github.com/robertjdominguez/flask-guide
   ```

2. Install required libraries

   ```Shell
   cd flask_guide && pipenv install

   ```

3. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install these extensions via the following commands...these will make our development process much smoother:

   ```Shell
   code --install-extension thekalinga.bootstrap4-vscode
   code --install-extension samuelcolvin.jinjahtml
   code --install-extension cstrap.flask-snippets
   code --install-extension gruntfuggly.todo-tree
   ```

4. Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) -- we'll use this later to tunnel a web-server and test on mobile.

5. Check out the TODO.md file. We'll use this as a task list to help us stay organized and move at the right pace.
